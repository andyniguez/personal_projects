Purpose: Color every vertext of a given graph such that the least amount of colors 
         possible are used, and such that no two directly connected verticies have
         the same color.

Files: GraphColoring.py
       graph.py
       <text file one> Represents the graph. First line is one number (vertex count)
                       Every line after that is 2 numbers separated by a space
                       (a connection between the two verticies represented by the numbers)
       <text file two> The result. Shows how many and what colors were used. Also shows 
                       the color of all verticies.

Use: In a terminal enter the line: 
     
     python3 GraphColoring.py <text file one> <text file two> 
     
     to run the program.
